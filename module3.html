            <h2>Module 3: Exoplanet Characteristics</h2>
            
            <h3>Size and Mass</h3>
            <p>Gas Giants: These are massive exoplanets similar to Jupiter or Saturn in our solar system. They can be much larger, such as KELT-9b, a "hot Jupiter" with extreme temperatures.
                Neptunian Planets: These planets are similar in size to Neptune and Uranus. They are often classified as "ice giants" and are typically rich in water, ammonia, and methane.
                Super-Earths: These are exoplanets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, with masses between 2 to 10 Earth masses. Examples include Kepler-452b and K2-131b.
                Earth-like Planets: These planets are similar in size to Earth and may be rocky. They are of particular interest because they could potentially support life, depending on their distance from their star.</p>
           <h3>Orbital Characteristics</h3>
            
            <p>Orbital Distance: The distance between an exoplanet and its host star can vary greatly. Some planets orbit extremely close to their stars (with orbital periods of just a few days), while others orbit much farther away, taking years or even decades to complete one orbit.
                Eccentricity: Some exoplanets have highly elliptical orbits, meaning their distance from their star changes significantly over time. This can lead to extreme variations in climate.
                Orbital Resonances: Some exoplanets are found in resonant orbits with other planets in the same system, where their gravitational interactions create stable orbital patterns.</p>
            <ul>
                <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
                <p>Chemical Composition: Exoplanet atmospheres can vary widely. For instance, the atmosphere of WASP-121b contains glowing water vapor and metals due to its proximity to its star. Others, like HD 189733b, have atmospheres rich in methane, ammonia, and other gases.
                    Temperature: The temperature of an exoplanet's atmosphere depends on its proximity to its host star. Some exoplanets, like KELT-9b, experience temperatures hotter than many stars, while others, like rogue planets, drift in space without a star and are extremely cold.
                    Clouds and Hazes: Many exoplanets have clouds made of exotic materials, such as silicates or metal oxides, and can have hazes of complex hydrocarbons.</p>
